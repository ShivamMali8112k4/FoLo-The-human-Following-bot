# Human Following Robot using Arduino

This project is a **Human Following Robot** built using Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensors, and DC motors.  
The robot can detect a person in front of it and follow them by controlling the motor speed and direction.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects human movement using ultrasonic and IR sensors.
- Follows the person while avoiding obstacles.
- Low-cost and simple to build.

## 🛠️ Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- IR Sensors (for side/object detection)
- Motor Driver Module (L298N / Motor Shield)
- DC Motors + Wheels + Chassis
- Battery Pack
- Jumper Wires

## ⚡ Working Principle
- The **ultrasonic sensor** measures distance between the robot and the human.
- The **IR sensors** help in direction correction and obstacle detection.
- Based on sensor input, the Arduino controls the motors to move forward, stop, or turn.
